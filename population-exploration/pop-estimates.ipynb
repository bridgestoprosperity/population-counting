    "This workbook reads in village boundaries and bridge locations and creates a dataset of villages that are within 2 km of at least one bridge. The dataset associates each of these villages with a list of the bridges it is within 2 km of (often it is just one). It then extracts population values for each village from the WorldPop 2020 raster dataset."
